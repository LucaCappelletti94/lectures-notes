\chapter{What is this for?}
This is not meant as a guide to learn Angular but as a cheat-sheet to get started quickly when it has passed a few weeks since your last angular project and you need to refresh your memory. I hope it can be useful.

\chapter{Creating a new project}
\section{Installing Angular CLI}
Firstly we install the \href{https://cli.angular.io/}{Angular CLI} if it isn't already present:

\begin{minted}{sh}
npm install -g @angular/cli
\end{minted}

\section{Creating a project}
Obviously you will want to create a new project, and of course you will want to have \href{https://sass-lang.com/}{Sass}, \href{https://getbootstrap.com/}{Bootstrap}, its UI for angular \href{https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/}{UI Bootstrap} and an angular UI framework such as \href{https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/}{PrimeNG}. To get all of this, just type the following:

\begin{minted}{sh}
ng new My_New_Project --style=sass
\end{minted}

Then after having entered the directory (\mintinline{sh}{cd Project}) we just install the packages:

\begin{minted}{sh}
npm install primeng bootstrap angular-ui-bootstrap --save
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{sh}
npm install node-sass --save-dev
\end{minted}

\section{Creating a component}
\begin{minted}{sh}
ng generate component MyCustomComponent
\end{minted}

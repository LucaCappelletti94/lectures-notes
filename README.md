Here's what you need to get started:

### Setup for macOs users
Luca wrote a set of small tutorials just for you:
- [MacOs quick setup ðŸš€](https://gist.github.com/LucaCappelletti94/c9ead039ecaf08dfaf8b975862d9d15e): getting started with macOS in a quick bashy way.
- [Sublime Text on Steroids ðŸ’ª](https://gist.github.com/LucaCappelletti94/d12c4c003e126f864402a887339fa912): a quick guide to get a super sublime text.
- [Firing up LaTex on macOS ðŸ”¥](https://gist.github.com/LucaCappelletti94/920186303d71c85e66e76ff989ea6b62): a setup for making latex just work.

### Basic Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- *metadata.json*: where you can put data to be loaded everywhere.
- **packages/**: .sty files that are hard to find.
- **general/**: folder for all the components that are used across all projects. Generally, it's a bad idea to edit this files. If you do, KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. KEEP A BACKUP.
    + *footer.tex*: wrapper for the footer elements, like the acronyms.
    + *custom_math_commands.tex*: wrapper for custom math commands.
    + *acronyms.tex*: collection of acronyms.
    + *packages.tex*: collection of shared packages and scripts.
    + **lua/**: a folder with our lua scripts.
        * *deapnessGuesser.tex*: script to automatically guess the deapness of the subfile you are currently compiling, so that lua scripts can be referenced from anywhere.
        * *highlight.lua*: switch that loads from *metadata.json* and enables or not the highlight of **emph**, **textit** and **textbf**.
        * *languageSwitch.tex*: switch that loads from *metadata.json* and enables or not the languages texts.
        * *metadataLoader.lua*: loads and merge recursively metadatas.
        * *title.lua*: title page built with lua. 
    + **figures/**: a folder with the .tex files relative to automations with figures.
        * *center_all_floats.tex*: automatically centers tables and figures (generally ll floats), including subfigures.
        * *default_figures_location.tex*: automatically sets **H** as the default location for figures and tables.
        * *packages_for_figures.tex*: specific packages for figures.
    + *title.tex*: uniformed title page.
    + *pyro.ist*: graphical description for acronym page.
- **subject/**: folder with a single project data.
    + **images/**: folder for the images. Every image gets its path from here.
    + *metadata.json*: data specific to folder.
    + *main.tex*: main file.
    + *references.bib*: references file.

## Latex template
If you like the way we setup our notes, [here](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/various-notes/tree/master/template) you can find a template you can play with. Notify us when you use it, as sometimes we need to update it (last update on 15/11/2017).

Here's what you need to get started:

### Setup for macOs users
So, if you've never dealt with the bash, here's a setup that starts from the beginning. If you're alredy a power user, you can skip these commands and go to the next part.
#### Installing brew, anaconda and git
So, [brew](https://brew.sh/) is this pretty awesome package manager for macOs, similar to **apt-get** in many ways. Here's how you get it. You need to have [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) installed to proceed.
Open up the terminal and proceed with these commands:
```sh
# We Install the command line tools
xcode-select --install
# We accept the developer license
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
# We install brew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# We run a couple checks on brew
brew doctor
brew update
# We install Anaconda
# If the command fails (it's a big file), try downloading from https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos
brew cask install anaconda
# We install git
brew install git
# We install a git IDE
brew cask install gitkraken
```
#### Setting up everything for latex.
Here starts the actual setup for Latex:
```sh
# We install the MacTex.
# If the command fails (it's a big file), try downloading from http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html
brew cask install mactex-no-ghostscript
# We install a LaTex IDE
brew cask install texmaker
# We install a couple of packages we're gonna need for LaTex
# Pygments handles highlighting
# It should already be installed with Anaconda, so you shouldn't need to run this command.
# sudo pip install Pygments
# We need though to create a link:
sudo ln -s /anaconda3/bin/pygmentize /usr/local/bin/pygmentize
# Gnuplot draws nice graphs
brew install gnuplot
```
Now you just need to clone the repo and get working!

## Latex template
If you like the way I setup my notes, [here](https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/various-notes/tree/master/Template) you can find a template you can play with.

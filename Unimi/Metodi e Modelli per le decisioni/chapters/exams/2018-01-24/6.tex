\subsection{Exercise 6}
Model and resolve the following decision problem in uncertainty conditions.

We want to order a pizza from a distant restaurant that sells it at \$10. It is possible to get it personally or to request the home delivery, which costs \$2, with a probability of the 2\% that the delivery delays and the pizza gets cold. In this scenario the pizza is free, and we can either choose to eat it as such with a discomfort measurable as a expenditure of \$5 or to heat it up again in the home oven, with a probability of the 10\% to burn it and having to go to the restaurant downstairs, where a pizza costs \$15.

If one choses to retrieve the pizza by himself, there's a probability of the 10\% that the pizza gets cold. In this scenario, one can either eat it cold with a discomfort of \$5 or ask to the restaurant for having it re-heated, with a cost of \$1 and a discomfort measurable as an expenditure of \$1.
